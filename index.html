        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element is a container for metadata. meta elements contain information
              about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements - the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays
              on a webpage. When possible, use semantic HTML elements because they make your
              HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. They also play an important
              role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the wide variety of users, including
              those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements include the div element which is used to create a 
            division in the page, or the span element which is used to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section 
            in a document that contains thematic content. They allow us to elegantly
            organize the content on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
